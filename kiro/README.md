# Kiro – The Local Guide

This project is a simple prototype built for the Kiro Week 5 Challenge: The Local Guide.

The goal is to demonstrate how an AI-style assistant can provide location-specific guidance using contextual logic.

This implementation focuses on a proof-of-concept rather than a production-ready system.
